# CCUEE - Data Sturcture
 Programming language: C
 
> ## Project_1 ... Database Management System
> 1. Write a program to establish Database Management System.
> 2. User can use the SQL instruction (e.g., INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE) to query database.
> 3. Please use linked list to store data (more details are provided in the folder of Project_1).

> ## Project_2 ... Relational Database Management System
> 1. Write a program to establish Relational Database Management System.
> 2. In addition to common SQL instructions (i.e., INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE), user can use "undo" and "redo" to query database.
> 3. For SELECT instruction, the conditional statement of "WHERE" has no limitation on the length of input.
> 4. Please use linked list to store data (more details are provided in the folder of Project_2).
> PS. My implementation of undo and redo:
>     1) v1 ... Using STACK to store the status of database.
>     2) v2 ... Using double linked list to store the status of database.

> ## Project_3 ... Coming soon
