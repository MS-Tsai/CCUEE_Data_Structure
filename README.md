# CCUEE - Data Sturcture
 Programming language: C
 
> ## Project_1 ... Database Management System
> 1. Write a program to establish Database Management System.
> 2. User can use the SQL instruction (e.g., INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE) to query database.
> 3. Please use linked list to store data (more details are provided in the folder of Project_1).

> ## Project_2 ... Relational Database Management System
> 1. Write a program to establish Relational Database Management System.
> 2. In addition to common SQL instructions (i.e., INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE), user can use "undo" and "redo" to query database.
> 3. For SELECT instruction, the conditional statement of "WHERE" has no limitation on the length of input.
> 4. Please use linked list to store data (more details are provided in the folder of Project_2).
> 5. My implementation of undo and redo:
>     1) v1 ... Using STACK to store the status of database.
>     2) v2 ... Using double linked list to store the status of database.

> ## Project_3 ... Command Line System
> 1. Write a program to establish Command Line System.
> 2. User can use MS-DOS instructions (e.g., mkdir, rmdir, cd, del, find, copy) to create the virtual data system.
> 3. Please use stack to implement "cd" instruction (i.e., go to next layer ... push, back to previous layer ... pop).
> 4. Please use linked list to store data (more details are provided in the folder of Project_3).
> 5. Bonus function is commented by default.

> ## Project_4 ... Car Queueing Problem
> 1. Write a program to solve this problem with minimum time (should do optimization).
> 2. Read the cars.txt and lane.txt to create the corresponding queue.
> 3. More details are provided in the folder of Project_4.
> 4. Bonus function is not provided here.

> ## Project_5 ... Coming Soon
